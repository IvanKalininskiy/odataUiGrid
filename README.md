# Odata uiGrid
UiGrid extension for working with [odata](http://www.odata.org/) protocol thanks to
[ODataAngularResources](https://github.com/devnixs/ODataAngularResources).

This is a work in progress and there is a demo application with two grids,
one using odatav4 and the other odata v3 demo endpoints.

You can also look at the online [working demo](http://plnkr.co/8mp5MQ).

## How to use
Install the bower package, add it to your index.html and load `odata.ui.grid` module to your main angular application.
```
bower install odata-ui-grid
angular.module("app", ["odata.ui.grid"]);
```

## How to run the demo
The project comes with a demo application and a complete automated gulp build process with dev server, just run:
```
npm install
bower install
gulp build
gulp dev
```

## Limitations and ToDo's
- There are still some problems when filtering 'Int' type columns with filters like 'starts_with'.
- Custom date filters (use a calendar widget selector).
- Unit tests.
